# CyraBot
[![Discord Server](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Realm%20Defense-green)](https://discord.gg/AUzWpS9)

This is a bot for Realm Defense discord server using the base bot: https://github.com/Kaldzkur/DiscordBaseBot.

It supports server moderations as well as displays various information on mobile game Realm Defense: Epic Tower Defense Strategy Game.

## Main Features
In addition to the basic features inherited from the base bot: https://github.com/Kaldzkur/DiscordBaseBot, the CyraBot has a few specific features for the Realm Defense game.

#### 1. Transformation between Cyra/Elara
A cool visual transformation in the server every 2 hours which changes the bot's role, name, and profile picture. Bot owners can use `?transform` to force a transformation.

#### 2. Various Information Commands
A large number of information commands showing game general information. Most of them are displayed in a pretty discord embed. Pure-text information commands can be built as custom commands by command masters, which is an inherited function from the base bot.

#### 3. Interactive Stats Commands
Hero stats, hero ability, tower, enemy, item, buff commands include stats which are data-mined from assets files and not directly shown in-game. Hero stats, hero ability and tower commands have a fancy "interactive" fashion that the output embed will update based on your reaction made to the message. You can easily explore the hero/ability/tower list, change the hero rank/level or even transform hero forms in a single command.
