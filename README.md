# DiscordBaseBot
This is a basic general purpose bot for discord using discord.py api.
It supports many features, including but not limited to a moderation suite.

## Installation
You need a few PyPI packages for this bot to work:

````bash
pip install -U discord.py
pip install -U python-dotenv
pip install -U pytz
````
## Extending the bot for your discord
Creating your own custom bot is fairly easy.
First you fork this project and create a new file for your bot in the root directory.
This file should contain the class of the bot, inheriting from the BaseBot.

````python
import discord
from base_bot import BaseBot

class MyBot(BaseBot):
  pass
  
if __name__ == "__main__":
  import os
  import dotenv
  from base.modules.interactive_help import InteractiveHelpCommand
  dotenv.load_dotenv()
  TOKEN = os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN")
  OWNER = os.getenv("OWNER_ID")
  SERVER = os.getenv("SERVER_ID")
  #This lookup maps all cog names to a name used in the interactive help.
  cog_categories = {
    "Administration":["Database Commands", "Settings Management Commands", "Administration Commands"],
    "Moderation":["Message Management Commands", "User Management Commands", "Channel Management Commands", "Moderation Commands"],
    "Miscellaneous":["Command Management"]
  }
  bot = MyBot(
    command_prefix="?",
    owner_ids=set([OWNER]),
    case_insensitive = True,
    help_command = InteractiveHelpCommand(cog_categories)
  )
  bot.set_main_server(SERVER)
  bot.run(TOKEN)
````
